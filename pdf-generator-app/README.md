## PDF Generation Process

The application uses the following process to generate PDFs:

1. Load a template PDF file from the public directory
2. Extract user input from the form
3. Add text fields at specific positions on the PDF
4. Generate and serve the modified PDF for download

## Customization

### PDF Template

The application uses a template PDF stored in the `public` directory. You can replace this template with your own PDF by:

1. Adding your PDF to the `public` directory
2. Updating the template path in `src/lib/pdfGenerator.js`
3. Adjusting the field positions according to your template

### Field Positions

The positions of text fields in the PDF are defined in `src/lib/pdfGenerator.js`. You may need to adjust these coordinates to match your specific template:

```javascript
const positions = {
  tradeName: { x: 170, y: 720 },
  legalForm: { x: 170, y: 680 },
  // ... other positions
};
```

### Form Fields

You can customize the form fields in `src/app/page.js` to add or remove fields as needed.

## Examples

The application includes example data to help you test the PDF generation:

1. Go to the Examples page
2. Browse through the pre-filled business examples
3. Click "Use this example" to pre-fill the form
4. Generate a PDF with the example data
